# Compare the performance of different models and strategies. (20 points)

# 1. Use at least three transfer models that you've trained using task(b) and perform ensemble
# learning. Try out the following ensemble techniques (Stacking, Boosting, Weighted Average,
# Max Voting, Bagging) and analyze whether the performance increases or not.

# 2. Try out different image preprocessing techniques such as, Ben Graham, Circle Cropping,
# CLAHE, adding gaussian blur, sharpening up the images etc.

# The goal of task(d) is to perform ensemble learning by training various models and combining their
# predictions and analyzing whether it boosts the performance. Along with that, applying multiple
# preprocessing techniques to see if that has any effect on the model
